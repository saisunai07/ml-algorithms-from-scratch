# Clustering Algorithms (Unsupervised Learning)

Clustering is a fundamental technique in unsupervised learning used to group data points based on similarity — without needing labeled data. It helps discover hidden patterns and natural groupings in raw datasets.

In this repository, you'll find clustering algorithms implemented from scratch using pure Python and NumPy to demystify how they actually work behind the scenes.

Algorithms Covered:
K-Means Clustering
A centroid-based algorithm that partitions data into K distinct, non-overlapping groups. It's simple, fast, and widely used in applications like customer segmentation and pattern recognition.

Key Concepts:
No labeled data required

Groups similar data points based on distance metrics

Useful for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering


# Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms

Dimensionality reduction is essential when working with high-dimensional data — it helps simplify the dataset while retaining the most important features or structures. It makes models faster, more interpretable, and often more accurate by removing noise and redundancy.

This repository includes from-scratch implementations of two powerful dimensionality reduction techniques:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
PCA is a linear technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system by projecting it along the directions of maximum variance.

Key Concepts:
Reduces dimensionality by finding the principal components (orthogonal axes of greatest variance)

Based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix

Commonly used for data visualization, noise reduction, and speedup of machine learning models

What You'll Learn:
How to compute the covariance matrix

How to extract and sort eigenvalues/vectors

How to project data into lower dimensions using matrix multiplication

Kernel PCA (KPCA):
Kernel PCA extends PCA to nonlinear data using the kernel trick. It projects data into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation is possible, then performs PCA in that space.

Key Concepts:
Captures complex, nonlinear patterns in the data

Uses kernel functions (like RBF or polynomial) to compute similarities

Great for visualizing nonlinearly separable data (e.g., concentric circles or spirals)

What You'll Learn:
How to compute the kernel (Gram) matrix

Centering the kernel matrix before decomposition

Performing eigendecomposition on the kernel matrix

Example Applications:
Technique	Use Cases
PCA	Face recognition, gene expression analysis, visualization
KPCA	Nonlinear feature extraction, image denoising, anomaly detection
